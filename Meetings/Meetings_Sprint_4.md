Meet with Tarshen Monday 24th May to review Sprint 3 get ready to begin Sprint 4

Meeting with Mr Jiahao 25 May 12:00pm:

For Sprint 4:

- Implement job filtering on Available Jobs page (being able to sort through jobs according to different criteria)
- Get labeling functionality working and capturing responses.
- Labeling should occur on the site; keep track of current images that have been labeled.
- Begin labeling on Accepted Jobs page, be directed to new page where we have images side to side with available labels and then save responses. 
- Job owners should specify how many labellers can split the job/credits and how many credits they will be allocating to the job.
- Some type of completion feature (either reached max. no. of labelers or job is completed) - Users should also be able to continue labelling from the state that they left off
  
**Team met after meeting to prioritise backlog for Sprint 4
